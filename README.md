Work Day Scheduler

Here is a work day scheduler using starter html and css code.  Added JS code using moment.js to create the time and local storage.  When using the scheduler it should allow the user to enter in a task/event for the time frames given and save them.  When the time comes for that event it will be marked red and upcoming with be green, while past with be gray.
